This repository contains custom JS scripts made by me to be compatible with [MorePurpleMoreBetter's 5e character sheet](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet)


# Scripts in this repository
- Starblade Class by Ariadne's Codex of Strings

# TODO
1. Only show Improved Maneuvers if regular ones are picked (Extrachoice?)
2. Weird line break after fighting style in PDF
3. Replace features with improvements
